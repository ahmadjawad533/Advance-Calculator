# 🧮 Java Calculator Application

This project is a **Java-based calculator** that allows users to perform a variety of arithmetic, trigonometric, and mathematical operations using either a **command-line interface (CLI)** or a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

The application is built entirely using **core Java** and demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, input validation, control structures, mathematical operations, and GUI development with **Swing**.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The calculator has two primary modes:

- ✅ **CLI Version (`Calc.java`)**: A menu-driven terminal interface where users input their choice and values.
- ✅ **GUI Version (`CalcGUI.java`)**: A desktop application using Swing that allows users to select operations from a dropdown and get instant results.

This makes it a great example for beginners learning both **console-based logic** and **basic GUI programming in Java**.

## 🛠️ Features

The calculator supports the following operations:

### ➗ Basic Arithmetic
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulus

### 🧮 Powers & Roots
- Square (x²)
- Cube (x³)
- Square Root (√x)
- Cube Root (∛x)
- Power (xʸ)

### 🔁 Advanced Functions
- Factorial (n!)
- Trigonometric functions (input in **degrees**):
  - Sine
  - Cosine
  - Tangent

### 🚨 Input Validation
- Division or modulus by **zero**
- Factorial only for **non-negative integers**
- Proper error messages for invalid operations or empty inputs
- Formatted decimal outputs (up to 6 digits precision)
